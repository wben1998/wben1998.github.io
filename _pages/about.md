I am a Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of Toronto, with teaching, software development, and QA experience across academic and industry settings.

My current work focuses on:

- Building full-stack web applications with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern databases
- Supporting large-scale undergraduate courses as a Teaching Assistant and Head TA
- Contributing to collaborative software development through code review, testing, and agile workflows

Recent highlights include a usability study presented at the UTSC Undergraduate Research Symposium, open-source contribution work in Apache Superset, and internship experience in both software development and quality assurance.

Please see my [CV](/cv/) and [Portfolio](/portfolio/) for details.
